# MethodMaster

Turn your course materials into exam-winning methodologies. The AI analyzes, predicts, and coaches you to **master** your exams.

***

## 🚀 Vision

MethodMaster helps students who “know the course but fail the exam” by focusing on **method**, not just content.
The app targets prioritization, solution strategy, structured answers, and exam-trap handling so that your reasoning becomes systematic and reliable.

***

## 🎯 Problem

- Ineffective revision: passive rereading with no clear hierarchy between concepts, skills, and exercise types.
- Fuzzy methodology: you know formulas but not how to chain them into a robust reasoning pipeline.
- Unpredictable exams: hard to anticipate which skills will actually appear.
***

## 💡 Solution

MethodMaster converts your course materials and past papers into a full system of methodologies, flowcharts, and personalized exam predictions.
The app gives you a coaching environment (text + voice) that trains your method instead of just memorization.
***

## ✨ Core Features

- **AI course analysis**: automatically extracts key methodological skills from your PDFs, DOCX, PPTX, or images.
- Method flowcharts: step-by-step solution organigrams for each skill, including common traps and tips.
- Predictive FocusMap: analyzes past exams to estimate the probability of each skill appearing in the next test. [
- Method-Help chatbot: an AI tutor trained on your courses that guides your reasoning without directly giving the final answer. [

- Interactive training: practice each skill with generated exercises and real-time AI coaching on your responses.
- Voice coaching: explain your reasoning out loud and get instant feedback on structure and rigor.
- Statement analyzer: upload a photo or PDF of an exercise to detect which skills are required before you start solving. 
- Smart solutions (Lazy Mode): “ideal” solution scripts aligned with your methodology, including traps, tips, and intuitive explanations. 
- Cognitive profile: tracks strengths, weaknesses, learning style, and generates targeted recommendations.

## 🧠 Lazy Mode – Smart Solutions

For any given exercise (photo or PDF), MethodMaster generates a model solution structured according to your course methodology.
- Highlights exercise-specific traps.
- Explains shortcuts and clever tricks.
- Details the underlying mathematical intuition behind steps.
- Saves your solution history for later revision.

## 🏗️ High-level Architecture

- Frontend: modern SPA web app (e.g. React / Next.js / Vue) for the student dashboard, training flows, and uploads.
- Backend: Lovable Cloud.
- AI layer: LLM integration (Gemini) for course analysis, flowchart generation, FocusMap predictions, chatbot tutoring, and voice-feedback processing.
- Storage: database for users, course content, extracted skills, training sessions, and cognitive profiles.
- Auth: secure signup/login and session management.

## 📚 Roadmap Ideas

- Deeper analytics on progress per skill and per exercise pattern.
- Full “mock exam” mode with corrections fully driven by the learned methodologies. 
- Mobile/PWA companion for quick revision sessions.
- Community or cohort sharing of methodologies and FocusMaps by subject or program.
